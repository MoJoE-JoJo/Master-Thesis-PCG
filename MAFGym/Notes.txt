Observartions are in a discrete grid of a fixed size of what is on the screen

Handle vectorizing the environment on the Java-Side, as it seems a little finicky to get the Py4J library to actually use different ports 
(handle with threads in Java, outcome should be more or less the same, as there will still only be one agent in python, that is just using several environments run simultaneously in Java)

For the generator action space, 3 different types are needed, the start slices, the middel slices, and the end slices
(the start-slices contains a M, and the end-slices contains a F)

Need to handle tubes (t,T)

wedsneday night: run lvl 1,2,7,8 as trained on a signle level in the old environment
tursday night: run lvl 1,2,7,8 as trained on multiple levels in the old environment

thursday: Implement one-hot encoding in the gym-environment, and streamline it into 1 environment
Friday: Finish up the one-hot encoding, and potentially make gym support vectorization
Friday night:  run lvl 1,2,7,8 as trained on a signle level in the new environment
Saturday: Make a trello with tasks
Saturday: run lvl 1,2,7,8 as trained on multiple levels in the new environment
Saturday night: Run evaluations so it is ready to make graphs on sunday
Sunday: Make graphs
