The randomly generated levels are just harder than the handcrafted levels. This could also lead to it being harder for a generator to actually generate solvable levels. 
This goes to show, that even though this solver can solve the levels, it would have been beneficial to have a better agent that could generalize better, or have it trained for a longer time
